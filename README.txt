Introduction

Welcome to Delay Lock. This program is designed to produce and retrieve alphanumeric passcodes that are not only hard to memorize but also require the user to wait before they can be accessed (hence, DELAY Lock). In short, this program allows the user to make accessing something an ordeal, ideal for situations where a device or online account would be a distraction were it to be readily available.

Delay Lock works as follows. First, you create a keyfile. The program will ask for a length for the passcode, a number of seconds to delay each time the passcode is generated, and a location to save the keyfile to. The keyfile will be written and the passcode displayed. Afterwards, whenever you wish to access the passcode, tell Delay Lock to generate the passcode using the keyfile. After the number of seconds specified when the keyfile was created have passed, the passcode will be displayed.

Operation

1. Creating Keyfiles

The basis of Delay Lock is the keyfile; using the data in this file, the program will produce a passcode composed of random numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters (the passcode will be the same each time a particular keyfile is used; using different keyfiles will produce different passcodes).

To create a keyfile:
- Click the "New Keyfile" button.
- Specify how long the passcode should be.
- Specify the number of seconds the user should wait each time the passcode is generated.
- Specify the desired keyfile location.

The keyfile will be created and the passcode produced immediately (without the delay).

WARNING: Once the keyfile has been created, do NOT change any of the data within it; the generated passcode is reliant on every piece of information stored within the keyfile, including the number of seconds spent generating it.


2. Generating Passcodes

Once a keyfile has been created, the same passcode will be generated every time that keyfile is used to generate a passcode (including when the keyfile was first created).

To generate a passcode:
- Click the "Generate" button.
- Enter the random strings displayed by the program. The delay between prompts, as well as some frustration during this step, is to be expected; the one who wrote this program decided to be a bit of a prick.
- Locate the keyfile you wish to generate a passcode from.

The program will begin generating the passcode, the process taking an amount of time approximately equal to the number of seconds specified when the keyfile was created. You can cancel generating the passcode at any point during this time. The passcode will be displayed once it has been generated.



Warnings

Possible Loss of Data

Delay Lock does not back up passcodes or the keyfiles used to generate them. If a keyfile is lost, corrupted, or changed in any way, Delay Lock will no longer be able to generate the associated passcode.
Distributions of the Delay Lock program may not always be available and may be subject to change without notice. If Delay Lock changes, it may not produce the same passcodes as it did before the change.
To prevent data loss, back up and protect either the passcode or the keyfile AND a copy of the Delay Lock program (or both).

Not Meant to be Secure

The passcodes generated by Delay Lock are meant to be long, random, and hard to guess or memorize. However, anyone with access to a keyfile and a copy of the Delay Lock program is capable of using them to generate the passcode associated with that keyfile.
To prevent possible breaches of security or privacy, do not use Delay Lock to produce and store passcodes meant to secure access to files or accounts without securing the keyfile.
